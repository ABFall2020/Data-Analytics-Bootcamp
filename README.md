This project shows screenshots of some of the results from the created VBA code. 
The VBA code takes yearly stock data from multiple years in a worksheet, and lists out each individual stock ticker and that ticker's yearly change, percent change, and totla stock volume. 
This project also includes filtering out the greatest percentage increase, the greatest percentage decrease, and the greatest total volume.
